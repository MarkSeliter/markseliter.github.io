												About
											</h2><br>

											<p>
												Hello my name is Mark, I’m a cyber security enthusiast trying to turn my hobby into a profession! I've majored in Computer Science and Physics in high school and then I joined the Israeli Defense Force at august 2016. I served there as both a drone operator and a combat soldier. The drone’s model was Skylark 1, which is lightweight and very silent, perfect for reconnaissance.

												In the army I’ve participated in numerous missions and operations which greatly improved the safety of both the citizens and the safety of forces who worked with us cooperatively. The main goal was to collect data and watch for anomalies, the smallest details could lead to very drastic conclusions. My comrades and I had to think outside the box in order to think like our target/s in order to outsmart them. 
												I have a story which I feel very proud about. I helped save the lives of a small group of soldiers that were almost trapped inside a village surrounded by hostiles. It was late at night and my mission was to watch over a target if there were any escapists. However, I felt that something was off. I immediately started looking outside the scope of the target in order to falsify or approve my suspicion. The thing is… I’ve seen hordes of people coming from all directions and marching toward this small group of soldiers with blunt objects and molotovs. I notified this group immediately and quickly found their best escape route. I’ve guided them through it all til they were out of harm’s way. They don't know me and I don't know them either, but I’m glad that lives were spared thanks to my quick thinking.

												I’ve finished my service and by april 2019 I became a citizen. At this point I wanted to enjoy myself and travel around the world and see interesting places and create wonderful memories. So I started working in retail and later moved on to security. The goal was to collect enough money for all the traveling I’ve planned to do and save some for university as well. Before 2020 I’ve managed to travel to Berlin and Austria and I had a lot of fun!

												And then the year 2020 came, the pandemic. At this time I was on and off from work depending if I was quarantined or not. This was a very confusing and frustrating year for me, the time I had for traveling wasn’t a reality anymore so I had to shift my focus on studying. At first I didn’t really know what I wanted. I read and researched various topics. At first I wanted to be either a physical therapist or a nurse, because I really like working with people and I am very much into health and fitness. However I found out that this is not the path I want to take in life.
												December 2020, This marks the beginning of my journey into cyber security! It started from an interest, I’ve heard about it from a friend who didn’t really work at it at the time but participated in CTF competitions. I’ve asked him where I should start and what should I do? He told me to try the CS50X course and see if I can understand how a computer thinks and works and maybe then we can talk. So I’ve studied a bit of C and python and even made a small web application. In this course I had coding challenges, I remember the awesome feeling I felt when I finally got to the conclusion and got everything to work. I can never get enough of this feeling, it is really amazing it is always driving me to try new things and experiment.
												After finishing that course I’ve decided that I want to focus more on cyber security. My friend told me to try picoCTF. He didn’t hold my hand and tell me what to study or how, I was thrown into the water and had to struggle and research on my own. The only tool I had at my disposal was the search engine. And this was the best experience and the most invested I’ve ever been into studying. It was so fun I struggle to even put it to words! I was really addicted to solving CTFs at one point, to be honest I still am. Later on it evolved into experimenting with virtual machines and a bit with AWS as well. Not much AWS but I did want to create a VPN that I manage and I get to choose what to log and what not to log.

												After months of having the time of my life from finally finding my passion in life, my friend who served in the 8200 unit sent me a message. He told me about a cyber security bootcamp that is funded by the 8200 Alumni Association and by the Israeli Innovation Authority. The bootcamp’s name is CIP8200 and it is taught by Cybint. He told me to try it out and see if it fits me. Because he knew I am very passionate about cyber security and privacy. At first I was very skeptical about joining a bootcamp, the reason is because I’ve felt very confident in my ability to succeed on my own, the internet has all the data for me just to reach and take it for myself. However, I decided that there would be no harm in trying it out. So I've done the interviews and the exams for the course and sort of forgot about it.
												Around march 2021, I was at my position at the old security job, Suddenly I get a message. I opened my phone and to my surprise I was accepted into the bootcamp! Apparently out of about a thousand candidates only fifty were accepted, That’s crazy! As of writing this story I’m studying for a little more than a month in this amazing bootcamp which taught me a lot about networks and the cyber world.

												In parallel to the course I’ve began playing around in TryHackMe. So far it is an amazing experience. Unlike picoCTF which the challenges were mainly application based, TryHackMe is more network based, Scanning ports… exploiting vulnerabilities… uploading shells… It is so cool I really do feel like Mr Robot! A very awesome show by the way I recommend you watch it if you have the time.
												And the story continues as I still discover and learn new things and enjoy my dive into cyber security, thanks for reading!
